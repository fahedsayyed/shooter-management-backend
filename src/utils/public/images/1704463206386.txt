 const athleteChecks: any = useSelector((state: AppState) => state.athleteRegister);

 //--check errors to disable submit button ---
  const areAllFieldsFilled = (slide: any) => Object.values(slide).every((value) => value !== "");

const isSlideOneFieldsFilled = areAllFieldsFilled(athleteChecks.slideOne);
 setDisabled(!isSlideOneFieldsFilled);


this is validation 's some logic for checking all field should be field 
and this is how data is dispatch

  const updateFormData = useCallback(() => {
    dispatch(setSlideOneFormData(formData));
  }, [ combinedSlideone]);

now i want to use these validation similarly for my addCompetition  ,s filed as already i have applied valiadation and setup of reducer for its field now before submitting i want it should check the manadatory fields are field
